'''
In a file called interpreter.py, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then
calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. Assume that the userâ€™s
input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:

    x is an integer
    y is +, -, *, or /
    z is an integer

For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.

Note that, just as python itself is an interpreter for Python, so will your interpreter.py be an interpreter for math!

expression = input("Give an arithmetic expression: ")

x, y, z = expression.split(" ")
x = int(x)
z = int(z)

if y == "+":
    print(float(x + z))
elif y == "-":
    print(float(x - z))
elif y == "*":
    print(float(x * z))
elif y == "/":
    print(float(round((x / z),1)))
