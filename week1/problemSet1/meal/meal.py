Suppose that you’re in a country where it’s customary to eat breakfast between 7:00 and 8:00, lunch between 12:00 and 13:00, and
dinner between 18:00 and 19:00. Wouldn’t it be nice if you had a program that could tell you what to eat when?

In meal.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it’s breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time.
If it’s not time for a meal, don’t output anything at all. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted in 24-hour time
as #:## or ##:##. And assume that each meal’s time range is inclusive. For instance, whether it’s 7:00, 7:01, 7:59, or 8:00,
or anytime in between, it’s time for breakfast.

Structure your program per the below, wherein convert is a function (that can be called by main) that converts time, a str in
24-hour format, to the corresponding number of hours as a float. For instance, given a time like "7:30" (i.e., 7 hours and 30 minutes),
convert should return 7.5 (i.e., 7.5 hours).
'''

def main():

    time = input("What time is it? ")
    if 7.0 <= convert(time) <= 8.0:
        print("breakfast time")
    elif 12.0 <= convert(time) <= 13.0:
        print("lunch time")
    elif 18.0 <= convert(time) <= 19.0:
        print("dinner time")

def convert(time: str) -> float:
    hours, minutes = time.split(":")
    new_time = float(hours)+float(minutes)/60
    return(round(new_time,2))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
