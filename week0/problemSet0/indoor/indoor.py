#In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in
#lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user
# explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

#Recieve the input from user
string = input('-->')

#str method to lower case
print(string.lower())
