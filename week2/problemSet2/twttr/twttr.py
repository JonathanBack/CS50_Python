'''
When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter
was originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then
outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.
'''
abreviation = ""
word = input("Input: ")

for letter in word:
    if letter.lower() not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]:
        abreviation += "" + letter

print("Output: ", abreviation)
